‚ö†Ô∏è **Note: This is a quick experiment - bugs included!** This is a proof-of-concept built to explore visual programming for WorkAdventure. Expect rough edges and incomplete features.

## Features

- **Visual Canvas**: Drag and drop blocks onto a canvas and connect them with visual lines
- **Complete API Coverage**: 60+ blocks covering all WorkAdventure APIs (chat, camera, player controls, UI, navigation, rooms, spaces, events, variables, and more)
- **Control Flow**: If/then logic, loops, and conditional statements with visual connections
- **Real-time Code Generation**: Automatically generates clean TypeScript code as you build
- **Interactive Properties**: Edit block parameters directly in the visual interface
- **Professional Output**: Generates production-ready WorkAdventure scripts

## What it does

Perfect for map creators who want to add interactive features like custom chat commands, camera controls, player interactions, UI elements, and complex game mechanics without writing code. Makes WorkAdventure scripting accessible to designers and non-programmers while still generating professional-quality TypeScript output.

## Tech Stack

Built with React, Next.js, and a custom visual programming engine designed specifically for WorkAdventure's API structure.
